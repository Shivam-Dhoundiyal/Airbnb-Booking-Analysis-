# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis-

Project Summary -
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.
This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.
The first step was data pre-processing, which involved treating null values and outliers in the dataset. Then, the following analyses were conducted:
1. Analysis based on host with calculated host listings count: The total number of properties owned by different hosts in every neighbourhood group was analysed. It was found that the Sonder(NYC) from Manhattan is the busiest host and has the maximum number of properties.
2. Analysis based on price with neighbourhood group: The prices of properties in different neighbourhood groups were analysed, including minimum price, maximum price, and mean price for each neighbourhood group. It was concluded that Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens have the maximum prices.
3. Analysis based on order of price: The properties were sorted into price ranges from highest to lowest. The most expensive properties were found to be "Furnished room in Astoria apartment" from Queens, "Luxury 1 bedroom apt. -stunning Manhattan views" from Brooklyn, and "1-BR Lincoln Centre" from Manhattan.
4. Analysis based on room types with neighbourhood group: The total number of different room types was found in each neighbourhood group. It was observed that private rooms and entire home/apartments were mostly occupied in the neighbourhood groups Brooklyn and Manhattan.
5. Analysis based on availability of room with neighbourhood group: The availability of rooms in each neighbourhood group throughout the year was analysed. It was found that Staten Island has the most available days in a year.
6. Analysis based on top place with neighbourhood group: The place with the most number of reviews was found in each neighbourhood group. It was concluded that "Room near JFK Queen Bed" has the most number of reviews.
Overall, these analyses provide valuable insights into the properties listed in the dataset and the trends in each neighbourhood group.
In addition to the insights mentioned, the analyses also provide information that could be useful for people looking to rent or list properties. For example, the information on the busiest host and the most reviewed property could be helpful for someone looking to book a property with a reliable host or in a popular location. The information on the most expensive properties could be useful for someone looking for a luxurious stay, while the data on room types and availability could be helpful for someone looking for a specific type of accommodation or a flexible booking option. Overall, the pre-processing and analysis of the dataset provides a better understanding of the New York City rental market and could assist individuals in making informed decisions when renting or listing a property.
